Stylish Battle Ranks is a mod that transforms combat in Minecraft into a stylish and dynamic challenge, inspired by hack-and-slash games. During battles, players receive style ranks that change based on the variety and effectiveness of their attacks. Mindlessly hacking away at mobs won’t earn you high scores—achieving an SSS rank requires skillful combos of strikes, critical hits, blocking, and different types of damage.

The mod features a dynamic music system that adapts to your rank: the higher your style, the more intense the music becomes. It supports custom tracks in FLAC and OGG formats, which can be configured in the mod settings.

But it’s not that easy - repetition is punished: spamming the same action repeatedly won’t grant points, and taking damage will lower your stylish ranking. Variety, strategy, and aggressive gameplay are the keys to mastering Stylish Battle Ranks!

## Details

## Music system


The music system is a changing track, revealing more and more depending on the rank. Unfortunately, there is currently no original track in the mod (it may be in the future), so to start feeling the style in battle, you need to place the ogg track in the config/stylishbattleranks/music folder and select it in the client config of the mod with the selectedTrack parameter. 
After that, you can already log into the game and feel the style, you can change the track and sound by command /sbr, but to fully reveal the mod, you need to add some kind of add-on to the track in the same music folder in json format. You can read more about it here.

## How to be stylish?

The very essence of the "style" in mod is adapted to the realities of minecraft battles. To be stylish, you need to be diverse. Change the ways of destroying enemies as often as possible and make as few mistakes as possible. The mod initially has some degree of compatibility with all others. This includes different types of damage, which also affects the style, as well as new weapons replacing vanilla axes and swords (more specifically, with the same tags).
If you really have style, you will literally hear and see it.

## Future innovations

There are already quite a few plans to refine and supplement the mechanics of battles. I am waiting for your feedback to expand them. Here are some of the plans:
 - New textures
 - The original music
 - More style triggers
 - More information about the style
 - More integration with other mods
